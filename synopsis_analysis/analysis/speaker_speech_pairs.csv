Speaker,Speech
SHRI P.P. CHOUDHARY,"In President‟s Address, all the main issues be 
it internal security of the country, foreign policy, need for infrastructural facilities, 
health care, education, roads, problems of farmers and Bharat Nirman Yojana have 
been covered.  Besides, important schemes concerning National Solar Energy 
Mission, Rail Project and effective measures to launch drive against corruption and 
bring back black money stashed by Indians abroad and policy to provide affordable 
justice to common man have also been included therein.  I am sure that consequent 
upon these measures the country will make progress by leaps and bounds and 
achieve stable 9 per cent growth rate and will ensure full participation of dalits, 
minorities, farmers, workers and women in the development of the country."
SHRIMATI P.K. SREEMATHI TEACHER,"The President Address 
contains the policies and programmes of the Union Government.  One of the 
Policies announced by the Government is the proposal to introduce diamond 
quadrilateral high-speed trains in the country.  It is a welcome move.  At the same 
time, the Government should take effective steps to improve the condition of the 
Indian Railways which is in shambles.  Majority of our railway stations and trains 
are in a pathetic condition.  Even basic amenities like drinking water, toilets etc. 
are not available in trains and at the platforms. Hence, our first priority should be 
to improve the conditions of the Indian Railways.  It is a welcome move that the 
Government is committed to provide 33 per cent reservation to women in 
parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.  It is heartening to note that the 
Government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women.  But 
the fact is that not only the country but also the entire world is witnessing crimes 
against women in India.  Child trafficking and drug trafficking are widely 
prevalent in the country.  Effective mechanism should be brought in to find out the 
organized drug mafia net work in the country and punish them.  In order to 
strengthen qualitative higher education in the country more central universities 
should be set up in each and every State.  In order to encourage sports in the 
country sports infrastructure should be set up in large scale in all States.  A large 
quantity of grains stored in our FCI godowns is getting rotten.  In order to prevent 
this Public Distribution System should be strengthened.  Effective steps should be 
taken to prevent farmers‟ suicides in the country.  Farmers should be provided 
fertilizers at subsidized rate and loans at low interest.  The minimum support price 
should be increased.  A National Social Security Board for the unorganized sector 
workers should be created.  Effective laws should be made to prevent the rise of 
black money in the country.  Law should be made for judicial accountability in the 
country. High Courts should be set up in every State capital.  More AIIMSs, should 
be set up in the country.  Import of rubber should be stopped to help the rubber 
growers of the country."
ADV. JOICE GEORGE,"As the Government is having absolute majority 
in the house, I hope that the secular values of our nation would not be undermined 
during the tenure of this government.  There is a need to address issues relating to 
the agrarian community as good governance can‟t be ensured without addressing 
the problem faced by the agrarian community.  Today, the farmers are finding it 
very difficult to pull on their lives due to the fluctuations of the prices of the 
agriculture produces.  Hence I request the government to formulate policies and 
make laws for the purpose of protecting the interest of the farmers so that they may 
get a reasonable price of their agricultural produces.  Another issue is the 
apprehensions of the people living in the Western Ghats regions due to the 
recommendations made by Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel.  The report of 
the panel is not acceptable to agrarian community as it didn‟t consider the real 
issue of conservation involving of the people living in the area.  The 
developmental aspiration of the people would be curtailed if the recommendations 
of the report are made applicable.  There is a need to pay more attention to the 
matter concerning the SC/ST people in the areas of providing basic amenities and 
infrastructure support.  The efforts for improving the educational facilities should 
also be included in the programs for improving the quality of imparting education."
SHRI TARIQ ANWAR,"President‟s Address is the roadmap of the 
Government.  Everybody is aware that the mandate in these elections is clearly in 
favour of BJP and NDA and all of us accept it because the mandate given in a 
democratic set up is ultimate and we welcome it.  We would like to assure the 
Government that the Government will get our support in all those initiatives taken 
by it which are for the welfare of the people and the country.  We are not going to 
oppose just for the sake of opposition.   Its seemed from the speech given by Rudy 
ji yesterday that the country want to adopt Chinese model of growth instead of 
Gujarat model of growth.  He also said in his speech that nothing has been 
achieved in the last 65 years.   However, it is very hard for a person to accept new 
ideas once he makes up his mind in favour of a particular idea or notion.   History 
is going to tell us as to what were the achievements of the UPA Government 
during its tenure. They have shown a golden dream to the people of this country 
which they will have to realise.  Now no excuse will work as they enjoy full 
majority in the House.  They will have to work for the country.  I read in the 
Address that the government is concerned about the minority community.  They 
are talking of bringing minority community into the mainstream.  But my 
suggestion is that charity begins at home and ironically not a single MP from 
minority community has been elected on their party ticket.  Besides, they are 
trumpeting everywhere that they invited the heads of various SAARC countries.  
But they forget that this is the same country which led the Non-Aligned Movement 
and has always been at the forefront in external affairs.  Therefore, they need not 
pat their own backs that they have done something extra ordinary by inviting all 
the heads of SAARC countries."
SHRI SHIVKUMAR UDASI,"I support to motion thanks on the 
president‟s address.  General Election 2014 was an election of hope.  The people of 
India voted decisively in favor of development.  I hope government will commit to 
make weaker and downtrodden sections of the society equal partner in the progress 
of the nation.  It is good that the Government is in favor of all-round development 
through good governance and it is pledging the principles of “Sabka Saath, Sabka 
Vikas” by functioning on the mandate “Minimum Government, Maximum 
Governance”. The government has shown its commitment to increase investment 
in agriculture, especially in agriculture infrastructure with the uniform crop 
insurance to all the farmers.  The Government has said that it will launch a 
National Multi-Skill mission whereby our youth can compete with the world‟s 
youth.  The Government has also said that it will improve the fiscal deficit by 
reducing inflation.   However, priority should be given to strengthen our share in 
global trade and increase GDP.  Crop insurance scheme is ailing since its 
inception.  Obvious maladies of the scheme are low coverage of crops, low 
awareness of farmers, low access of farmers to institutional credit, low operational 
performance, low education of farmers and continuous banks‟ failure in achieving 
the target of priority.  Therefore, I request the government to consider a uniform 
and unvarying crop insurance scheme which will be much more beneficial to 
farmers.  I welcome Government‟s move to develop infrastructure with 
connectivity and modernizing the Railways with diamond quadrilateral project of 
High speed trains.  People of this country have reposed immense hope and faith in 
this Government.  So now it should come upto the expectations of the people  by 
building a strong, self sufficient self-confident India so that India could regain its 
rightful place in the comity of nations.    
KUMARI SHOBA KARANDLAJE: In the President‟s Address there is a 
roadmap for the new Government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji.  
The Government is committed to provide 33 per cent reservation for women in the 
Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.  With a commitment of ‘Beti 
Bachao-Beti Padhao’, “the Government will have a policy of zero tolerance for 
violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system”.  The 
strong law should be enacted to protect women.  Young generation is looking 
forward for strong India. Internal security and external security of India is priority 
of our Government.   All are waiting for the stringent action against anti-nationals.  
This is rightly mentioned in the President‟s Address that this Government is 
dedicated to the poor.  Poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair 
has no geography.  The greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty 
in India.  This Government will not be satisfied with mere „poverty alleviation‟.  
The country is experiencing a new type of governance that is clean, competent as 
well as compassionate and transparent.  The Government is committed to 
providing a clean and efficient administration.  Digitization of Government records 
will be done for improving accessibility."
SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL,"I support the President‟s Address.   
He has shown the commitment to lead the country on the path of development by 
creating atmosphere of confidence amongst the people of the country. This 
Government would meet the expectations of the people of the country.  
THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THE MINISTER 
OF OVERSEAS INDIAN AFFAIRS (SHRIMATI SUSHMA SWARAJ): I rise 
to support the Motion of Thanks on the President‟s Address moved by Shri Rajiv 
Pratap Rudy in the House yesterday.  In the past, we have heard, read and even 
discussed such Addresses in the House but the present Address is something 
different.  It is different because in this Address right from the first page to the last 
page we have not leveled any allegation on the previous government.  Rather we 
have stated what is our stand with regard to the solution of the problems being 
faced by the country.  This Address starts with the clear cut mandate that we have 
got and this mandate has given a new dimension to the Indian politics.  As a party 
we got 282 seats and with our allies this figure reached to 336 seats.  There were 
two main reasons for such victory.  First, there was public resentment against the 
previous government and second, the people chose BJP led by Shri Narendra Modi 
as an alternative for the country.  That is why the barriers of caste and creed were 
broken in this election, the candidates became secondary and the people brought us 
victory by margins of lakhs of votes.  But having achieved this victory we are 
aware that big victory entails bigger responsibility.  That is why we accept this 
verdict of the people with great humility.   
It has been said in the Address that this election is the election of hopes. So, 
we have to come up to the expectations of the people.  We have identified ten 
factors responsible for public resentment against the previous government in this 
country.  These ten factors are: inflation, corruption, scams, plight of farmers, 
declining of industrial growth, slow pace of trade and commerce, unemployment 
among youth, crimes against women, misuse of institutions and undignified 
treatment meted out to the soldiers on the borders.  So far as inflation is concerned 
we have given it a top most priority and we have mentioned in the Address that we 
will take effective measures to curb both black marketing and hoarding to rein in 
inflation.  So far as corruption is concerned, our government is fully resolved to 
make country free from corruption and black money.  So far as curbing scams is 
concerned, we have reiterated our resolve that we would provide good governance 
and make the system transparent.  Regarding the plight of the farmers, I would like 
to say that our farmers are facing adverse conditions and are sometimes compelled 
to commit suicide.  Today, agriculture is no longer a profitable occupation.  
Therefore, we reiterate our commitment that we would make agriculture a 
profitable occupation again.  So far as industrial growth is concerned, the country 
has come to a standstill.  No growth is taking place.  I am happy that our Prime 
Minister has given three mantras – skill, scale and speed.  With these three mantras 
we will definitely accelerate the pace of industrial development.  So far as the slow 
pace of trade and commerce is concerned, we have said that we will improve the 
situation and we will not only increase domestic trade but also be able to compete 
in world trade.  So far as unemployment among the youth is concerned, we are 
going to launch a multi skill mission so that skill may be developed among young 
talents who may become self employed and live the life with dignity.  Regarding 
women empowerment, I have repeatedly said that if we want the upliftment of 
women four things are needed – education, security, economic independence and 
political empowerment.  So far as 33 per cent reservation for women is concerned, 
I want that the passage of Women‟s Reservation Bill should become a milestone 
for 16th Lok Sabha. So far as misuse of institutions is concerned, such incidents 
have weakened the federal structure of the country.  We know that federal structure 
is the life and blood of the Constitution of our country and institutions like CVC, 
CAG and CBI are those pillars of democracy which should be allowed to function 
independently.  So, tussle between the Union and the States over the use of these 
institutions is not good for the democracy of the country.  That is why we have said 
that we will restructure institutions like NDC and integrate them as powerful team 
India.  So far as undignified treatment meted out to our soldiers is concerned, this 
Government will set up a national war memorial for its soldiers and implement one 
rank one pension scheme.   
These are all the ten points which have been mentioned in the Address.  
Besides, it has been said that no mention of schemes has been made in this 
Address. I want to say that we have stated some big schemes in the Address.  We 
have said that we will set up IITs in every state; we will set up hospitals like 
AIIMS in every state; we will build 100 new cities with world class amenities; we 
will launch diamond quadrilateral project on the lines of golden quadrilateral 
project of highways and finally we will revive the Ganga River.  Are these not big 
schemes? So far as our foreign policy is concerned I now can say that with the 
formation of our government the stature of India has risen overnight; India has 
regained its potential.  Finally, I want to say that we will keep India on high 
pedestal on international fora and this is our commitment."
SHRI RAMCHANDRA HANSDAH,"Unity in diversity is the 
characteristics of India.  No Indian becomes a patriot by saluting the map of India.  
The person who understands the diversity of the country and respects the people of 
different castes, religion and culture living within the boundary of the country is 
the real patriot.  Yesterday our BJP leader in the House has mentioned about 
backwardness of our state Odisha.  Our state is lagging behind in development 
parameters.  It is good that the founding fathers of our Constitution incorporated 
Articles like 330, 335 in our Constitution for establishing equality and giving 
social justice to the backward and downtrodden classes of the society.  Though it 
was a temporary provision initially for 10 years, we have to extend it for more than 
60 years.  But even after 65 years of independence, we have failed to bring social 
equality."
SHRI KAMLESH PASWAN,"The President has said that this election has 
been the election of hopes.  There cannot be two opinions that the people of the 
country have lots of hopes from this Government and this is the reason that after a 
long period 66.4 per cent voters have participated in the elections overwhelmingly 
and given tremendous and clear mandate to a single party.  I do hope that the 
people of the country have reposed faith on us and we will fulfill the aspirations of 
the people of the country.   Our objective is to work for good governance and 
development.  It will prove a stable and honest Government.  This Government 
will ensure to the people of the country an India which will be free from fear, 
hunger and corruption.  The President has raised several important issues in his 
Address.  I have been elected to this House from Bansgaon Lok Sabha 
Constituency from Uttar Pradesh and this region is lacking in the facilities like 
tourism and rail connectivity.  In Bansgaon there is ample scope for development 
of tourism in Bansgaon which can play an important role in our socio-economic 
advancement.  Bansgaon Parliamentary Constituency has been a center of culture 
and power since ancient times.  The President has said that in order to promote 
pilgrimage, the pilgrim centres of all the religions will be beautified and a mission 
will be started for improvement of public amenities and infrastructure there.  I 
demand that keeping in view the historic and religious importance of Bansgaon, it 
should be included in the tourist circuit.  The previous Government only gave 
assurances to the people and no work was done.  I demand from the Union 
Government that NH-29 be converted into four lane and Ram-Janki route be 
included in the list of historic heritage."
SHRI RAVINDRA KUMAR PANDEY,"Today after 30 years a 
Government led by BJP has come to power with a huge mandate.  This 
Government has created rays of hope among the people and has created an 
atmosphere of confidence among them.  The Government is committed to provide 
good governance and make India great.  In President‟s Address commitment has 
been made to eradicate poverty from the country.  More than 70 per cent 
population of the country lives in villages.  The Government is developing a new 
model of development for cities as well villages.  It will lead to allround 
development of the country.  India is pre-dominantly an agricultural country and 
the Government has promised to promote agriculture by increasing allocation for 
it.  With introduction of Pradhan Mantri Sinchayee Yojana, a new Green 
Revolution will start.  Yoga and Ayush etc. the ancient Indian health system will 
be promoted.  I welcome the policies to be framed to prevent exploitation of 
women.  I wholeheartedly appreciate commitments of the Government for 
rehabilitations of Kashmiri Pandits and to stamp out terrorism.  Introduction of 
high speed trains by modernizing the rail sector will be a big gift of this 
Government.  The Ganga is the longest and important river of the country and a 
commitment has been made for its revival.  The road map of development, 
progress, economic and good governance is visible in the president‟s Address.  
With these policies, the country will be called a developed a country."
SHRI PRASANNA KUMAR PATASANI,"The President‟s Address is 
merely a rehash of the election manifesto presented by the incumbent Government 
and not actually a blueprint.  The newly elected NDA Government appears to 
prefer wordplay and election slogans to a „concrete roadmap‟ on what it plans to 
do in the months ahead.  The BJP-led Government did not appear to be focused on 
governance, creation of jobs or containing inflation.   There is no concrete roadmap 
as to how are they going to achieve all this?"
SHRI MULAYAM SINGH YADAV,"Many promises have been made in 
this election.  The Prime Minister had mainly said four things.  He had said that 
with his Government coming to power, he would curb price rise.  We agree that he 
cannot check it in such a short span but he could at least reduce it a little bit.  
Further, if he was not able to reduce it he could at least do something which could 
stabilize prices.  Secondly, I want to say that he had said that the Government 
would provide employment to the youth and no one would remain unemployed.  
But there are still 8-10 crore unemployed people in the country.  Therefore, I want 
to know from the Government by when it will eradicate unemployment and stop 
the price rise.  It has been said that the land occupied by Pakistan in Kashmir and 
the land of India occupied by China would be taken back.  I want to know by when 
the land under occupation would be taken back.  He had recently met his Pakistani 
counterpart and he must have discussed Kashmir issue with him.  So he should 
inform the House what talks were held and what issues were raised during the 
meeting with Pakistani PM and also state the extent to which agreement on the 
matter has been reached.  Besides, he said that he will provide pucca houses to the 
people.  This promise should not remain as a mere announcement.  It should be 
implemented as well.  So far as Hindi is concerned, we not only raise the matter 
concerning Hindi but also of other Indian languages.  So, all the regional languages 
of India should be given due recognition.  The entire country is agog with 
excitement that everyone would get a pucca house.  Problem will arise when it 
would not be possible to provide pucca house to everyone.  If everyone gets a 
pucca house in ten years, our‟s would become the best country in the world. We 
have always given the slogan that food, clothing and shelter are the basic 
necessities.  We support Indian languages.  Local language is widely spoken in our 
party.  All the Indian languages especially regional languages be promoted and 
steps be taken for their translation.  This would be a big historical achievement.   
DR. KIRIT P. SOLANKI: The Government has shown its resolve to 
alleviate poverty in the President‟s Address. Inflation has been constantly rising 
during the last few years.  This government has shown its commitment towards 
controlling inflation on priority basis.  The Government has also resolved to 
provide urban amenities in rural areas and have presented a development model 
„RURBAN‟ which envisages providing urban facilities in villages without 
changing the basic character of the villages.  I am fully confident that this 
innovative model will result into the development of the villages.  The growth rate 
of agriculture sector can be accelerated further by increasing investments into the 
sector resulting in creation of better agricultural infrastructure and infusion of 
technology in this sector.   Talents in the field of sports could be brought to the 
national arena by launching National Sports Talent Search Schemes.  The health 
services will undergo radical change on account of launching National Health 
Assurance Mission.  I also welcome the commitment of the Government for the 
welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in pursuance of its objectives of the social justice. 
The promise of the Government to take the country on to the path of progress by 
strengthening the federal structure of the country through the participation of 
Centre and the States is a commendable step.  Country will make further progress 
by modernization of and investment in railways.  Proper utilization of the energy 
resources can be ensured by implementing the National Energy Policy.  The 
thriving culture of this country has found expression with the blessings of mother 
Ganga.  I thank the Government for taking the resolve of cleansing of the river 
Ganga.  I also welcome the resolution of the Government for enhancing the 
prestige of the country by extending the hand of friendship to not only her 
neighbouring countries but also to all the countries in the world."
SHRIMATI JAYSHREEBEN PATEL,"This BJP led NDA Government is 
committed to the cause of poor.  This Government has also taken a resolution for 
the complete alleviation of poverty.  This Government has brought the concept of 
Gujarat model of development for the upliftment of the rural areas comprising 
almost two-third of India‟s population.  It is worthy of praise.  The Government 
will try to achieve its maxim of „Minimum Government, Maximum Governance‟.  
The Government has come to power on the twin plank of development and 
governance.  The Government has also put forward its agenda of intertwining the 
National Talent Search Programme with the school curriculum and promotion of 
sports through education.  The Government will give top priority to contain 
inflation for which it intends to take effective steps against hoarding and black-
marketing besides improving the Public Distribution System.  The Government has 
also stated its intention of working with the global community in dealing with the 
challenges on climate front.   Mention of reviving Golden Quadrilateral Project has 
also found place in the President‟s Address.  The Government has constituted a 
special investigation team to curb the menace of black money and corruption 
which are eating into the vitals of Indian democracy.  This shows the true 
commitment of the Government towards democracy."
SHRI R. DHRUVANARAYANA,"Today, country is facing many issues, 
challenges and government must act carefully in addressing these issue and meet 
challenges.  Government should provide right market price to the farmers for their 
products.  Government has not talked much about its visions on social justice 
policies.  Government should lay out its constructive plan of action for social 
justice and women empowerment.  Government should act quickly on addressing 
the issues of water problems in co-ordination with State Governments.  
Government should not forget the agriculture sector demands and needs, while 
giving priority to manufacturing and other sectors.  Government should also lay 
out his visions and long term plans to empower youth of this country."
SHRI DADDAN MISHRA,"I support the Motion of Thanks on the 
President‟s Address.  There is a need to develop irrigation facilities in Shravasti 
Lok Sabha Constituency.  Shravasti should be connected to railway network.  An 
air strip should be developed there in order to harness the tourism potential of the 
India.   
CAPTAIN AMRINDER SINGH: Over 90 per cent of issues mentioned in 
President‟s Address are only old wine in a new bottle.  These are the same 
programmes of the Congress Party which have been brought in under some other 
name by the ruling government.  Form poverty alleviation they want to go to 
poverty elimination.  We would like to know how the Government would make 
100 cities in five years.  They are saying that in the 75th year of the birth of our 
nation which is eight years from now every home in the country, every village, 
every city is going to have 24x7 power and also toilets. How?   We have a very 
major problem of drugs in this country particularly in the Northern States and I do 
not know why this has not been raised.  In my State, may be 70 per cent of the 
people are reeling under drugs.  I have in my constituency a Mohalla which is 
called Maqboolpura, where about 90 per cent of the men have died because of 
drugs and ten percent are left who are on drugs and are likely to die.  How are we 
going to deal with this problem?  Are you going to give money for de-addiction 
centres?  The State Government has locked up about 20,000 young addicts.  They 
should be sent to hospitals.  Pick up the people who are actually trading in drugs 
and bringing drugs into this country.  We are just 44 in number.  Number does not 
matter, what matters is the quality to fight, to oppose.  „One Rank One Pension‟ 
was brought in by the last Government.  There are so many Acts which have not 
been mentioned in the President‟s Address.  We have the Right to Information Act, 
Right to Education Act and the Food Security Act.  Because of MNREGA people 
are getting work in their own states.  We also started the Rural Health Mission.  
The Government should take note of these in their programme and agenda for the 
future.  
*SHRI PREM SINGH CHANDUMAJRA: Democracy can install a 
common man as the ruler of the country and also dethrone a ruler.  This is the first 
time since Independence that a non-Congress party has won a landslide victory at 
the hustings and a non-Congress coalition has won a decisive mandate.  People of 
India were fed up with the corruption, scandals, scams, sky-rocketing prices and 
ever-increasing unemployment of the previous Government.  “Beti Bachaao, Beti 
Padhao” is an important scheme.  The State Governments have become powerless.  
The Central Government has continuously encroached on the domain of the states. 
I am sure that the federal structure will be bolstered.  We always championed the 
cause of empowering the states.  Funds must be provided to the states.  The State 
Governments must be consulted in matters that pertain to the states.  Only then can 
the states flourish. Prosperous states will lead to a prosperous India.  I am sure, 
agriculture will get an impetus under this Government.  The gulf between the rich 
and the poor is increasing.   10 per cent of the rich are gobbling up all the benefits.  
                                                          
* Original in Punjabi 
Agriculture has to be accorded due importance.  We talk about “Sabka Saath, 
Sabka Vikas”."
SHRI D.K. SURESH,"I support the motion moved by Shri Rajiv Pratap 
Rudy Ji and seconded by Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji.  NDA government came to 
power because it highlighted the issue of price rise during all election rallies. I 
kindly request the Government to clarify how you are going to control the prices of 
daily essentials like food-grains, vegetables, petrol & diesel, building materials.  
The Congress led UPA believed that the farmer needs to be adequately 
compensated for his hard work in the fields.  This is why we hiked MSP.  But 
NDA leaders are silent on this aspect.  UPA government initiated a historic 
opportunity to provide food security to crores of Indians and end the problem of 
hunger once for all through the Food Security Act. Under no other government has 
poverty declined as rapidly as it did under the UPA government due to 
revolutionary measures like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act.  The UPA provided Rs. 72,000 crore loan waiver to debt-ridden 
farmers.  Nirmal Bharath Abhiyan of our UPA government is renamed as Swachh 
Bharat Mission.  UPA government launched Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya 
Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.   The issue of water disputes has not been 
mentioned in the President‟s address.  The need of the hour is to have a national 
policy of water sharing between states concerned.  Protection of industrial 
labourers, unorganized sector labour, workers‟ rights and their welfare regarding 
health, pensions, insurance also requires your attention. In order to promote Indian 
languages, the central government should bring a national policy in regard to 
medium of instruction at primary level.  I welcome the proposal of the government 
to set up Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana."
SHRI SUGATA BOSE,"We only wish the new Government had utilized 
the President‟s Address better to give us and the country a clear enunciation of 
policies instead of a recitation of pious wishes. We share with the Government a 
commitment to build a strong India that will command the highest respect around 
the world.  We commend the Hon. Prime Minister for his initiative in inviting the 
leaders of SAARC countries to his Swearing-in ceremony. One of the biggest 
challenges of the 21st century will be for India and China to peacefully manage 
their simultaneous rise.  We agree with the Government that Japan can be our 
valuable partner in building world class infrastructure. I would like to say that we 
will extend our hand of cooperation in the conduct of foreign policy by the 
Government.  It is true that the federal spirit animating our polity in the past has 
been sadly diluted in recent years. We welcome the Centre‟s promise of 
cooperative federalism.  I call upon the Central Government in its reply to spell out 
what policies it will adopt to provide relief to debt-trapped States.  Western and the 
Northern regions lag behind the Eastern and the Southern regions in terms of every 
conceivable index of human development and social infrastructure, specially 
education and health.  The visionary Kannyasree scheme of West Bengal presages 
the Central Government‟s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign.   The highly 
successful Jal Dharo, Jal Bharo programme for water security holds lessons for 
the proposed Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana.   The Central Government 
would be well-advised to follow West Bengal‟s lead in becoming an enabler for 
modern Madrasa education with a minimum of State interference.  West Bengal 
will never permit the language of citizenship to be used as a façade for anti-
minority prejudice.  States must play a pre-eminent role in the field of education. It 
will not suffice to simply build IITs and IIMs in various States. We have to build 
world class universities on the solid foundation of primary and secondary school 
education."
SHRIMATI RAMA DEVI,"At the outset, the President in his Address 
expressed his concern regarding the existing poverty in the country and mentioned 
the commitment of the government to eradicate it, to provide help and all types of 
facilities to the citizens through empowerment which is commendable.  Although, 
more than two third of the people live in rural areas yet the previous government 
failed to provide basic facilities and livelihood opportunities.  Most of the people 
in our country depend on agriculture.  During the past few years the farmers had to 
face unprecedented difficulties. The commitment of present government to 
improve this unfortunate situation mentioned by the President, has enthused the 
farmers. “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana” would provide succour to the 
farmers.  The President mentioned the formulation of a new health policy in his 
Address. The plan of the Government to launch a “Swachh Bharat Mission”  has 
given me personal satisfaction.  The commitment of the government to reserve 33 
per cent of seats in State Legislatures and Parliament for women would certainly 
increase the participation of women and their empowerment. Comprehensive 
judicial reforms are needed.  Like Gujarat, “Night Courts” should be set up in other 
states also.   
SHRI B. SHRIRAMULU: Hon‟ble Prime Minister has a strong 
commitment to fulfill the promises he made to the people of the country.  He 
always used to inspire people that they would see good times in the near future.  
The new Government has drawn up a time bound programme to translate its 
promises into actions.  The Government has started taking steps to improve every 
aspect of governance to ensure all round development of the country.  In the last 
ten years the economy of the country had collapsed.  Inflation was touching new 
highs.  The rupee had reached an all time low against U.S. dollar.  People of the 
country were in great distress.  A few cities of the country are dominating higher 
education. However, the President‟s Address spelt out the opening of IITs and 
                                                          
 Original in Kannada. 
IIMs in all the states.  Thus, higher education and technical education would reach 
each and every corner of the country.  I would say that in the near future students 
from America and Australia would line up in queue to get Indian visa for higher 
education.  The new Government is committed to provide in every village basic 
facilities like Sulabh Toilets.   The Government has constituted SIT to unearth 
back money stashed away in foreign banks.  This step made people happy.   “Ek 
Bharat Shresht Bharath” slogan of the President‟s Address is a symbol of our 
Patriotism.  Rural areas of my constituency Bellary are facing drinking water 
problems. My district is drought affected.  Therefore, I request a special assistance 
to solve these problems.  The government will develop 100 cities of the country 
and upgrade them to world class cities.  I request the government to sanction an IIT 
in Bellary district."
SHRI BISHNU PADA RAY,"Andaman and Nicobar Islands can also be 
develop as a world class tourist destination like Singapore.  Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands have India‟s one third exclusive economic zone and the exploitation of it‟s 
marine wealth will make India‟s economy stronger and provide large scale 
employment also.  During the NDA regime Port Blair Airport was renamed Veer 
Sawarkar and it was to be made an international airport.  But even after 10 years 
there has been no progress.  I request that it be implemented at the earliest.  
Similarly, during the NDA rule construction of 333 km. of national highway from 
Chiriyatappu to Diglipur, in Port Blair was announced.  Crores were spend to 
reclaim land at Campbel Bay, the Southernmost tip of India without constructing 
Sunpub Gate and earthern dam.  CBI inquiry is necessary in this.  BPL survey 
should be done again in the urban city Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 
There is immense sports talent, specially, water sports, in our Island. Adequate 
opportunity should be provided to such sports persons. During the UPA regime the 
support price of copra was Rs. 44/ Rs. 51.  But the agency purchased it for Rs. 
20/22.  This entire scam should be investigated by the CBI. There is a cooperative 
bank in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Its functioning should be immediately 
inquired into to save the bank.  Similarly, after the 2004 tsunami the Zilla Parishad 
misappropriated crores in the name of overhead water tank, pipeline, RO plant, 
earthen dam and sluice gate.  The CBI should enquire into this also.  Inter Island 
shipping service be strengthened. 
DR. DHARAM VIRA GANDHI:  The people of Delhi are suffering for the 
last few weeks because of acute shortage of power. The LG and the Delhi 
Administration should tackle this problem and ameliorate the suffering of the 
people of Delhi immediately. It is apprehended that the Government is planning to 
double the gas price from $ 4.2 to $ 8.4 per mmbtu with effect from 1st July, 2014.  
If this reckless pro-corporate and anti-people decision implemented, is fraught with 
dangers of serious repercussions for the economic life of the country through rise 
in price of fertilizers, transport and gas-based electricity.  The drug menace is 
widely prevalent among the youth in Punjab.  I request the Central government to 
take effective and immediate steps to seal the Indo-Pak border so that it no more 
remains pores and this evil design does not work anymore. Unless the entire 
network of drug addiction is smashed right from the top to the bottom, unless the 
youths are given useful employment after proper de-addiction drive, this problem 
is not going to be solved at all.   Punjab suffered grave losses both in terms of 
human life and economic derailment in 1980s and 1990s.   During all these years 
of turmoil, our State of Punjab is heavily indebted and is still paying huge 
installments of money every year to the Centre. I, therefore, strongly urge upon the 
Central Government to write off all the debts against Punjab and stop punishing the 
people of Punjab for no fault of theirs.  Our Party strongly condemns the spate of 
violence against women in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country and 
demands stringent, speedy and exemplary punishment against the perpetrators of 
such heinous crimes against women."
SHRI KIRAN RIJIJU,"The Government have decided to put its best foot 
forward with the excellent slogan ‘Ek Bharat, Aur Shreshtha Bharat’ and ‘Sab ka 
Sath, Sabka Vikas’.   It indicates the beginning of good days for those who felt 
alienated.  The decision has been taken to formulate Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana 
for the Schedule Tribes.  It seems that it is the beginning of bringing those people 
in mainstream who had been displaced from their water, forests and land.  All the 
North Eastern States are not inter-connected. The Presidential Address promised 
that the Government is going to provide inter-connectivity in North Eastern states.  
Conservation of Himalayan ecology has been a very sensitive subject.  A national 
mission on Himalayas has been on the anvil since a very long time.   We had also 
formed a Trans Himalayan Parliamentary Forum during Fourteenth Lok Sabha.   
80 per cent of fresh water in our rivers comes from the Himalayas.  Unless the 
Himalayas is conserved, the country cannot be healthy.  The Government 
understands it.  It is the responsibility of all Indians to conserve and save the 
Himalayas- the crown of India.  The Government has decided to outline setting up 
fifty tourist circuits and pilgrimage destinations.  With the implementation of these 
steps, the numbers of tourists visiting India will increase three or four fold.  We do 
not follow imperialistic foreign policy and also do not want war with our 
neighbours.  We rather want peace.   We also want to change the negative policy of 
the previous Government regarding border areas.  Our borders with China have not 
been delineated. The pact signed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpeyee in 2003 states that 
whenever the work for demarcating the border will be taken up then the inhabitants 
living on both sides of the area will not be disturbed.   The Prime Minister has 
given the vision of Brand India which means that the people from all walks of life 
will come together and work for the country, only then we will be able to get back 
our lost pride and honour and land as well since India has the inherent capability to 
lead the world. 
 SHRI RAMEN DEKA:  I welcome Hon‟ble President‟s speech which 
reflects new Government‟s policy.  The policy reflected the government‟s concern 
of common people.  The commitment to contain food inflation will give relief to 
the common mass.  The steps to be taken by establishing IIT, IIMs and AIIMS like 
hospitals in every States will help backwards States specially N.E. region.  I am 
happy to note that new Government promises to tackle the problem of infiltration 
on priority basis. Further Government emphasized to complete fencing work in the 
border at the earliest possible time.  Infiltration is a major issue in N.E. states, 
particularly in Assam.  Due to porus boundary illegal migrants are coming on daily 
basis and consequently demography of Assam is going to be changed. The new 
Government assures to lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region 
connectivity and border infrastructure will usher a new dimension of development 
in Assam and North-East states.  The Nation is looking forward for a united, strong 
and modern India."
SHRI RAJIV SHANKARAO SATAV,"Supporting the Motion of Thanks 
on Presidential Address said that Charity begins at home when they talk of 
development in the perspective of youths. This should be reflected in their 
formation of Cabinet. They have also talked about rights in this Address. But there 
is no mention of Right to Information Act nor Right to Education etc in this 
Address. This poses a question on their intention whether they want to abrogate the 
RTI? I would also like to request the Govt. to kindly pass the Women Reservation 
Bill within the stipulated time and refrain false promises to people."
SHRI BADRUDDIN AJMAL,"Flood, erosion, road connectivity and the 
lack of industries are the major issues in Barpeta, Assam.  Karimganj has the issue 
of mega road connectivity. The road connectivity in Assam has almost 
disappeared.     The Brahmputra has proved a devil to the people of Assam.  It has 
guzzled of almost 1.27 lakh hectare land and more than 30 lakh people in the last 
25-30 years.  The Brahmputra is the major blow on the developments of the 
Assam. In 1983, BTAD agreement was signed with the people of Bodoland areas.   
The Bodo people constitute only 29 per cent of the population and the interests of 
71 percent non-Bodo people were not safeguarded.  This is the main reason behind 
riots in Assam. The issue of riots in Assam would be solved only with the only 
with the protection of the interest of remaining population.  The Madarasas should 
be modernized.  Our party has the clear vision to seal the Bangladesh border so 
that the intrusion from Bangladesh could be stopped.  No foreigner entered after 
25th March 1971 should be let stay in India and all such Bangladeshi should be 
expelled.  This expulsion should be within the limit of the law or the Constitution 
of India."
SHRI RAMSINH RATHWA,"The Presidential Address is a vision 
document of this Government which is a reflection of work done in Gujarat and 
subsequently to the country by our Prime Minister.  The people of our country 
have expressed their confidence in him who will definitely try to fulfill their 
dream.  This is the first time in the history of India that BJP has got clear majority 
in the Lok Sabha. In spite of that slogan of NDA is “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”. 
 
The mention „Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana‟ in this Address is a good gesture 
and I welcome it wholeheartedly.  We will have to accord utmost importance to 
education as enshrined in our Constitution and will have to overhaul it, if needed.  
The people of India have seen a number of such leaders who gone scot free in spite 
of their involvement in scams and murders.  But advent of Sri Modi as a Prime 
Minister of India has kindled a new hope and aspiration in them.  Their intent and 
objectives have been made clear within days by the steps they have taken.  It is 
indeed a laudable step.  But we have to restrain patience as our policy and intent 
are crystal clear which will definitely bring prosperity in the country.  
DR. P. VENUGOPAL:  Promise to bring in a spirit of cooperative 
federalism to restore the federal spirit that had been diluted in the previous years is 
praise worthy.  The Government has a stupendous task ahead. Food prices continue 
to rise every month.   As India grows rapidly, the demand for high nutrition food 
goes up.  Lot of foodgrains rot in central godowns and do not reach the market 
efficiently. President‟s Address promises that the Government will come down 
hard on hoarding of food by intermediaries. We expect the Budget to make an 
allocation of money to boost the infrastructure to ease food supply.  I would appeal 
to the hon. prime Minister to accord priority and set up an AIIMS like institute in 
Tamil Nadu during the current year.  As regards railway network, Tamil Nadu has 
been left out so far.  Most of the urban and rural areas of Tamil Nadu still remain 
unconnected by rail. I hope Tamil Nadu will get its due share of new railway lines 
and new trains in the coming years."
SHRI JAYADEV GALLA,"People have voted for development and 
growth, for improving the basic needs through efficient administration.   I would 
urge that when we make the policies on industrial development, we should focus 
on how to create non-migratory jobs. Putting jobs where people are, rather than 
taking people to where jobs are. MGNREG Scheme, in spite of its good intentions, 
has actually depleted the labour force from organised industries.   It is not a case of 
lack of labour, but the labour is not willing to work. The lacuna in the MGNREG 
Scheme needs to be reviewed and policies need to be made so that not just 
unemployment, but under-employment is also studied.    Less than three per cent of 
the land is used for industry.  Land prices are skyrocketing. Land prices should not 
be a constraint for industrial development, and land acquisition policy and 
incentives should be linked to job creation as one of the matrices. We need both 
high-tech and low-tech jobs in India. In order to create a world class manufacturing 
hub, innovation, brand-building, technology and research and development is 
important. Electronic imports every soon are going to exceed oil imports.  That is a 
very troubling situation for our country.  I think, focus needs to be brought into 
improve the electronic sector and for that a FAB manufacturing Unit is critical. 
The President has said in his speech that 100 new smart cities will be created and I 
would urge that the very first one should be the new Capital of Andhra Pradesh.  
We are building flyovers, but we are forgetting about the needs of people who 
walk on feet and this also needs to be addressed.  Today, AP is left with a deficit 
Budget.  We have higher debt.  We have more power generation, but we are being 
forced to supply the lion‟s share of power to Telangana and the water situation is 
yet to be resolved.  Hence, clarity on these issues is of utmost importance if both 
the States are to go forward."
SHRI ARVIND SAWANT,"This year‟s general elections were full of 
hopes and aspirations.  South Mumbai is my Parliamentary Constituency.  A large 
number of people live in jhuggi-jhopris.  In the President‟s Address there is a 
mention of giving pucca house to all these jhuggi-jhopri dwellers.  There is a 
mention of total elimination of poverty from the country. Mumbai city provides 
maximum income tax to the Government exchequer every year.  Therefore, we 
want that the hon. Prime Minister should pay attention towards our city.  
Development of youth has also find a mention as also the national education in the 
President Address.  Today, public schools are mushrooming in our country.  The 
poor also want to send their children to these public schools.  This aspect should be 
taken into consideration while formulating the new national education policy.  I 
also hope that this government would address the problems being faced by our 
farmers.  Similarly, the problems of businessmen should also be addressed.  I 
welcome GST in this connection.  Cleansing of the River Ganga has also find a 
mention in the President‟s Address. This is a very good thing.  Similarly, I want 
that all the rivers of the country should also meet the same treatment.  I firmly 
believe that good days are about to come.   
DR. (SMT.) RATNA DE (NAG): The President‟s Address is full of 
promises but there are many vexed problems before our country.  Drought is 
looming large in the country.  Controlling floods would be a Herculean task for 
Government. From where the Government would plough funds for successful 
implementation of many popular schemes like Food Security scheme, 
MGNREGA?  West Bengal is reeling under financial stress and heavy debt burden 
due to which West Bengal Government is unable to take up developmental projects 
for the benefit of poor and downtrodden people.  I  request the  Government to 
intervene  in bailing out the state by announcing a three year moratorium on 
payment of interest.  I would urge the Government to stop spiraling of prices of 
essential commodities and petroleum products so as to help the poor and 
downtrodden.   There is a mention in the Presidential Address about interlinking of 
rivers.  The regional interests should be kept in mind while implementing the 
scheme of linking of rivers. There is no proper understanding between the 
insurance company, the agriculture department and the banks.  The Government is 
not having a monitoring mechanism in this respect.  Premium deposited by the 
farmers are wrongly accounted. With the result farmers are losing.  Government 
should announce waiver of loans taken by the farmers. All types of labourers in all 
the sectors should  get minimum wages.  More than 26 crore people cannot afford 
healthcare expenses and the Government hospitals cater to only a quarter of the 
people who approach the Government Hospitals desperately without any source of 
treatment.  Government hospitals, in urban areas be upgraded at par with the State 
of art private hospitals.  There is a necessity for new B.P.L. lists so that the acute 
poor and downtrodden would get the benefits of schemes which are made for them."
SHRI ARJUN RAM MEGHWAL,"It has been mentioned in the very first 
para of the President‟s Address that the legislative agenda of the 16th Lok Sabha 
will be productive and useful.  During the period of 15th Lok Sabha the legislative 
business of the House received a major setback.  The pace of urbanization of the 
country is going at the rate of 45 per cent.  It is mentioned in the President‟s 
Address that 100 new smart cities will be built.  The Prime Minister has launched 
the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana for irrigation purpose.  The manner in 
which the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana proved a milestone for the country 
similarly, this Yojana will also be proved a milestone in the history of the country.  
There are so many new schemes which have find a mention in the President‟s 
Address.  The Prime Minister would say in his election speeches that he wanted 
railways to be a growth engine of the country.  The same spirit has been reflected 
in the President‟s Address as far as the Railways is concerned.  Railways did not 
get the kind of priority it should have got during the UPA-I and UPA-2 regime.  
New priorities have been fixed for the Railways.  The Government will launch a 
national mission „e-Bhasha‟ that will help in the development of our regional 
languages.  This will also help in removing the fear of civil services aspirants 
having apprehensions about their not clearing the said exam.  It is also mentioned 
in the President‟s Address that hilly and desert areas will get the same facilities in 
order to develop these areas.  There are 3.25 crore court cases pending in various 
courts of the country.  The total number of judges in High Courts is 906 and 250 
posts of judges are lying vacant out of them.  The Government has fully 
emphasized the need for bringing about reforms in our judicial system. 
DR. KAKOLI GHOSH DASTIDAR: We promise to be by the side of the 
government for all their pro-people agenda but definitely we will be working as 
democratic watchdog and we will be critical on issues which are anti-people and 
anti-democracy.  It has been promised that pucca homes are going to be built for 
the poor people, and the road infrastructure is going to be given a lot of attention, 
which the rural India really needs.  We have promised here equal rights for the 
women and reservation for women in the Parliament.  We have not been able to 
fulfil our target of bringing down the maternal mortality rate and the infant 
mortality rate.  So, let us look into this matter very seriously.  As far as food is 
concerned, our State of West Bengal has been able to fulfil the demand of food.  
Sanitation is very-very important.  Sometimes girls are raped when they go out 
because there are no toilets in their houses.  So, we need more toilets not only to 
take care of these women but also as a means of cutting down on crime.  Our State 
would require more funds to build toilets for public purposes and women alike.  
Our State has three international borders with countries like Bhutan, Nepal and 
Bangladesh.  So, before any decision is taken regarding these international borders, 
we do wish to stress that our state government be taken into confidence.  It has also 
been said here that hospitals of the All India Institute of Medical Science kind are 
being planned for different states.  Our State Government has a very clear-cut land 
policy.  So, before the Government takes any action, we would request to 
definitely engage us. As far as the rail is concerned, the metro railway that was 
supposed to have taken place all round the city of Kolkata should be given some 
priority because our Chief Minister had already sanctioned money for the purpose 
when she was the Railway Minister.  I would really request to look at that.  The 
Dream liners which are being used have been found worldwide to be defective.  
So, I think these airliners should be taken away from circulation."
SHRI E. AHMAD,"I would just like to say that my Party is here in this 
House since 1952 and whenever we have to support the Government we support 
but it is also our duty to oppose whenever the Government goes against our 
polices.  Now we are in the Opposition.  It is our duty to function as a constructive 
Opposition during this time. Muslims form the largest section of minority 
community in India and we consider the Muslims here as a national minority.  It is 
the duty of every Government to provide a sense of security to this section of 
people.  I would also like to bring to the attention of this august House that there is 
a very poor representation of the Muslim community in the Government and 
Public Sectors.   Their legitimate rights and aspirations must be taken into 
consideration.  I would just mention that during the last few decades, countries in 
the Gulf have grown very much economically.  With these countries, we should 
maintain regular high level exchanges, economic exchanges, constant security 
dialogues and promotion of people-to-people exchange.  If the priorities as 
mentioned in the President‟s Address are implemented by this Government, we 
will also be happy about it. 
DR. A. SAMPATH: Presidential Address is silent on various crucial and most 
important questions of our nation face.  An IIT should be set up in Kerala having it 
HQ in the capital. A permanent bench of High Court at Thiruvnanthapuram should 
also be set up.  The creation of Peninsular Railway Zone having its headquarters at 
Thiruvananthapuram is also a long pending demand.  Attention should be paid in 
this regard. Our Railway should be people friendly.  The strict enforcement of all 
basic labour laws without any exception or exemption and stringent punishment for 
violation of labour laws is necessary.  Urgent measures should be taken for filling 
up of the 1.50 million jobs laying  vacant under various Union Government 
establishments and PSUs. Effective implementation of the land reforms through 
structural changes and legislations is highly necessary. I request the Government to 
scrap all anti-farmer international treaties in which India became a party.  
Government has a primary duty to curb the unprecedented rise in price of all 
essential commodities. Unless and until the FCI is strengthened and its activities 
more spread up, we will not be able to develop a strong PDS throughout the nation. 
Development, strengthening and universalisation of Integrated Child Development 
Scheme should be made and effective steps should be taken to check the 
malnutrition among the women and children in our county. The Government has to 
take strong steps to develop efficient water transport in the country.  Water is the 
most precious resource in the world and hence water resources should be protected 
at any cost. Policies should be for the relief and benefit of the people.  The tribal 
population in various parts of the nation are facing threats from the so-called 
apostles of development.  We have to protect the nature and environment."
SHRI ANTO ANTONY,"I am grateful for granting me an opportunity to 
participate in this debate on the Motion of Thanks on the Hon‟ble President‟s 
Address. I appreciate the Government‟s commitment to ensure a clean Ganga, I 
invite the attention to Holy River Pampa in Kerala. Pampa is one of the sources of 
water to districts in Central Kerala, and it also feeds, Kuttanad- the rice-bowl of the 
State. About 40 lakhs people depend on this river for various needs. River Pampa  
is shrinking in size due to pollution. As a result, the Biodiversity and the 
Hydrological terrain of Pampa Basin are facing a major threat. Therefore, I request 
the Government to launch a special programme to protect River Pampa. I request 
the Government to provide connectivity to Sabarimala in Kerala and delcare it as a 
National Pilgrim Centre and to up-grade infrastructural facilities at this Holy 
Shrine."
SHRI ANIL SHIROLE,"The responsibility to address the issues 
mentioned by the Hon‟ble President in his Address, lies with the government.  I 
hope that the government will fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people. The 
government aims to develop 100 new cities equipped with World-class amenities 
and specific infrastructure, looking at the issue of urbanization as an opportunity 
rather than a challenge.  I request that Pune may be included in the mission of 
Smart City."
SHRI HANSRAJ GANGARAM AHIR,"This Address presents the 
outlook and mind of the government.  Today, our country is facing the grave 
problem of irregular irrigation.  The State of Maharashtra gets only 19% irrigation.  
It leads to below than average agro-production in this State and the farmers incur 
heavy losses even after the MSP given to them.  So, the Government should 
restructure the MSP-regime, with profit calculated on the original cost. The Prime 
Minister Irrigation Scheme aims to encourage irrigation facilities.  I suggest that a 
National Fund for this purpose should also be created, vis-à-vis, to improve the 
situation.  There are hundreds of Malguzari water-bodies belonging to the British 
times which are on the verge of extinction due to lack of maintenance.  If the 
government propose to revive them, they can prove to be a great help in irrigation 
for Vidarbha‟s farmer community.  We need to protect our traditional rural 
vocations.  Proper amendments need to be carried out in the APMC Act to permit 
farmers to sell their vegetables and fruits outside their region. We have to 
constitute a National Health Commission to fight malnutrition and anaemia among 
tribal children and women and should innovate new ideas to enrich our traditional 
food with more nutrients."
SHRIMATI ANUPRIYA PATEL,"I extend my sincere thanks to Hon. 
President of India for his Address delineating the road map for India‟s future 
raising people‟s hope and aspirations.  I am glad that the Government‟s resolve has 
been underlined in this Address to take 125 crore of Indians onto the path of 
development and prosperity.  I would like to make my point confining myself to 
my parliamentary constituency, Mirzapur, my home state Uttar Pradesh and the 
challenges faced by the people belonging to the SCs/STs and OBCs.  As far as 
youths are concerned, unemployment is their biggest problem and the youths do 
not have ample opportunity of gainful employment.  Many youths being 
unemployed tend to involve themselves in criminal activities.  Such  circumstances 
are emerging fast especially in Eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bundelkhand.  
My parliamentary constituency, Mirzapur is also part east UP and such 
circumstances are quite visible there as well.  I hope that this Government would 
provide ample job opportunities to the unemployed youths so that they are not 
forced to leave their homes for employment. The Prime Minister Agriculture 
Irrigation Scheme has been mentioned in the President‟s Address which proposes 
to provide irrigation to all fields.  I would, therefore, request the Government to 
implement this scheme in Eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bundelkhand to 
provide irrigation facilities there.  Uttar Pradesh faces the huge power crisis these 
days.  The National Energy Policy finds a mention in the President‟s Address 
which is quite an ambitious scheme.  Uttar Pradesh would be benefited by this 
scheme providing succor to the power starved people of Uttar Pradesh.  Tourism 
promotion has been talked about in a big way in the President‟s Address and 50  
tourist circuits are proposed to be created to promote tourism.  I hope my 
parliamentary constituency, Mirzapur, would be considered for this purpose while 
implementing this scheme in the country.  In Lalganj and Haliya areas, a vast 
population of tribals reside who are deprived of benefits of development.  I hope 
that the Government would make earnest efforts to bring these people into the 
mainstream of the country.  We have a National Commission for Backward 
Classes but this Commission does not have effective judicial power which is a 
serious issue.  Recently, two girls belonging to the backward community were 
subjected to inhuman treatment but the NCBC could not make an effective 
intervention for the want of necessary judicial power nor could it do justice with 
the families of these girls.   We do not see the reflection of social diversity in our 
judiciary.  I would, therefore, request the Government to set up a Judicial 
Commission.  The provisions of OBC‟s reservation have not been properly 
implemented in our Central universities like JNU and DU.  I would, therefore, 
request the new Government to do justice to the deprived sections of the society.  I 
also hope that the Government would pay attention to create toilet facilities in both 
rural and urban areas so that we could atleast safeguard the dignity and respect of 
our women."
SHRIMATI POONAMBEN MAADAM,"The Address by the Hon‟ble 
President reflects the vision and the road map of the new government.  It spells 
several programmes and schemes meant for the upliftment of one and all, 
particularly the poor. Putting the economy back on track is the paramount for this 
government.  The Government will create a policy environment which is 
predictable, transparent and fair.  It will make every effort to introduce Goods and 
Service Tax.  I wish to highlight the much needed reforms in the agriculture sector.  
Two-thirds of our people live in rural areas and agriculture is the main source of 
livelihood for majority of our people.  The economic contribution of agriculture to 
India‟s GDP is steadily declining with the country‟s broad-based economic growth. 
This government will be committed to build confidence in our farmers by 
increasing investment in agriculture sector and scientific practices, by streaming 
the pricing and procurement procedure, by implementing crop insurance and post-
harvest management and by setting up of food processing industries. Dwarka 
which is in my constituency is a pilgrimage place which has tremendous potential 
for growth.  The need for air connectivity, adequate hotel infrastructure and 
improving the amenities will go a long way in the development of this temple 
town.  I want to bring out the issue of the state of the MSMEs in our country.  I 
come from the Jamnagar district in Gujarat, home to the Brass industry of India.  
The industry is plagued by problems in their day-to-day operations, that is , in 
production and marketing of their products. They face stiff competition from large 
firms.  Inadequate infrastructural facilities and access to credit are other major 
problems. We need to change this."
SHRI SURESH ANGADI,"The people of this country have voted for Shri 
Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of this country leaving apart the 
consideration of caste, creed and other things.  The British have ruled this country 
using the divide and rule policy.  Those rules are followed even today. The dalits, 
muslims and all these divisions in the society have been created and they are 
existing even to this day.  But this time, the people of India voted for Ekh Bharat, 
Shrest Bharat under the leadership of Shri Narendra Modi.  Today, we have got 
real democracy.  Allamaprahbu belong to the Scheduled Castes community. He 
was like Ambedkar of his times.  He gave 50 per cent reservation for women in 
those days but we are still fighting for 33 per cent reservations for women in 
legislative bodies even after 66 years of attaining independence.  I come from my 
constituency, Belgaum, we want the present Government to set up IITs and IIMs.  I 
request the Government to provide pure drinking water to all the villages and the 
urban areas of my constituency.  I would request the hon. Minister for Heavy 
Industries to kindly start some major public enterprises in my parliamentary 
constituency to provide employment.  I would request the Hon. Railway Minister 
to provide railway connectivity to Belgaum either with the bullet trains or with the 
fast track trains."
SHRI RAJENDRA AGRAWAL,"The hon‟ble President touches on almost 
all the social and national aspects of life.  Potatoes are grown on large scale in 
Hapur and its adjoining areas. Meerut, Baghpat, J.P. Nagar, Bulandshahar districts 
around Hapur altogether constitutes a big fruit-belt.  I urge upon the Government 
to set up a national level Research Centre on Food Processing at the birth place of 
the former Prime Minister Choudhary Charan Singh in his memory to guide and 
help the farmers in the processing of potatoes and various fruits. The hon‟ble 
President considered the lack of  strong basic infrastructure as one of the major 
impediments before India and said that the government would prepare an 
ambitious programme for infrastructure development. I request the government to 
take the responsibility of infrastructure development in Meerut-Hapur and provide 
a special economic package for this purpose.  It is also requested that an IIT or an 
IIM be set up in Meerut with a view to striking a regional balance. The 
Government has said that a multidimensional approach will be adopted for the fast 
disposal of a large number of pending cases to ensure timely delivery of the justice. 
The shortage of judiciary benches and judges is thwarting the early disposal of 
these cases. Hence, it is requested that a bench of Allahabad High Court may be set 
up in Meerut.  The policies of strategic importance for the country have been 
mentioned repeatedly. From this point of view hardware manufacturing should be 
given priority in the IT sector and the incentives and protection should be given to 
the hardware manufacturer so that our country may also be self-reliant in this 
sector."
SHRI M.I. SHANAVAS,"I have been closely following the speech of the 
President.  In the President‟s Address, unfortunately I was not able to find any 
vision, any new programme.  Only an extension of the programmes of 10-year rule 
of the UPA was seen in the President‟s Address.  „One Rank One Pension‟ is our 
such scheme.  It has already been implemented.  Since BJP is ruling the country, I 
looked for the word „secularism‟ in the speech.  Nowhere in the speech, the word 
„secularism‟ is used.  I looked for the word „Constitution‟. The word „Constitution‟ 
is missing from the speech of the President. So, what is the idea behind this?  For 
more than 55 years, this country has been ruled by the Indian National Congress.  
The Hon. Prime Minister called a meeting of the Secretaries and the Ministers 
were not allowed to enter that meeting.  It is the centralization of power. This 
centralization of power will no doubt harm the democratic principles.  I tell you in 
this august House that the Indian National Congress will come back like a storm in 
this House itself."
SHRI P. K. BIJU,"His Excellency the President Shri Mukherjee said that 
economy was passing through an “extremely difficult phase‟ and putting it back on 
track was a “paramount” objective of the government. But there is no blueprint to 
materialize the dream projects. Here, I would like to point out some of the 
important issues.  The emphasis on agriculture in Presidential Address is highly 
appreciable. While stating the government‟s commitments for saving the poor 
farmers, equal importance is also given to more private investment in agriculture. 
The diesel price has hiked after the new government, giving a clear indication of 
the continuation of the neo- liberal agenda followed by the UPA government.  
There is no reason why we should allow 100 percent FDI in defence which is a 
highly sensitive area in terms of security of our country. It is also not clarified 
whether the Government should instead get reciprocal access to foreign companies 
to transfer technology.  The presidential address speaks about “pension and health 
insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and access to modern 
financial services.” But nowhere have it mentioned about the job security and 
rights of the labour force which is already at stake with the private and PPP model. 
The much awaited and hyped Presidential Address is conspicuous with absence of 
the road map for the promises."
SHRI KAUSHALENDRA KUMAR,"The President‟s Address, a written 
document of the Government is a jugglery of words. Whenever new governments 
assume power, populist measures are announced but they are never implemented.  
Black-marketeering and profiteering are such issues which directly impact the 
price rise in the country.  The cooperation of the State governments is always 
needed in this matter.  During the election campaign, the NDA leaders had 
promised that Bihar would be accorded the status of a special category state and 
special package would also be given to Bihar in case the NDA comes to power.   
However, there is no clarity on this issue in the President‟s Address which is a 
worrisome situation for the states.  100 cities are said to be developed and 
equipped with all necessary facilities.  I would like to say that India is a country of 
villages and the poor, therefore there should be a scheme for development of 
villages also.  The famous tourist places of Bihar like Rajgir, Nalanda, Vaishali, 
Pawapuri and Bodhgaya should be connected with Tourism Circuit.  I would also 
like to draw the attention of the Government to revive the 19 sugar mills lying 
closed in Bihar."
SHRI DUSHYANT CHAUTALA,"I am thankful for having an opportunity 
to speak on the motion of thanks on the President‟s Address.  The Address reflects 
the aspirations of the country but one important aspect that is population control 
has been left out.  Our country is all set to overtake China in population.  It is 
mentioned that 100 new cities would be developed.  In the year 2001, four counter 
magnet cities including my constituency Hissar were declared.  But in the last 13 
years no investment has been made in Hissar by the Centre.  New counter magnet 
cities were declared in the year 2011 which included Ambala.  Developmental 
works have been started in Ambala but Hissar still remains neglected.  
Development in Kota has been stopped while Jaipur is being developed as a 
counter magnet city.  68 per cent population of my State works in fields.  
Electricity and water are the most important issues for the farmers.  9 out of 12 
thermal units in Haryana are closed.  The Central Government provided funds for 
their development but the State Government did not put it to use just to favour 
private power companies.  The people of State are crying due to crimes.  The 
Government talked about inter-linking about canals.  I would like to appeal to the 
Government to reconsider the Satluj-Yamuna link project in order to provide water 
to the farmers for irrigation.  The Government has mainly assured the people of 
providing house to every family and job to every unemployed.  This is laudable.  
Dalits are being subjected to atrocities in Haryana.  On the other hand, the 
Government has been involved in multi crore scams during the last 10 years in 
which thousands of acres of land of the farmers have been acquired in the name of 
education or SEZs.  The Central Government will have to take decision to provide 
compensation to such farmers."
SHRI GANESH SINGH,"I support the motion of thanks on the President‟s 
Address.  The Address includes the promises made by us during election 
campaign.  The UPA Government has completed its ten years but no problem has 
been solved rather these have been made further complicated.  Indira Awas Yojana 
was launched by the UPA Government but the homeless families are still waiting 
for shelter for generations.  Once, our friend Rahul Gandhi toured Bundelkhand.  
He was very sad to see the state of poverty of a tribal family that why our country 
was in such a state.  But, perhaps, he forgot that his grandmother and his father had 
been in power and even then his party was in power.  Had they identified the tribal 
to provide one pucca house each, had this problem not be solved?  Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee ji, as Prime Minister, decided to connect 6.5 lakh villages with all 
weather roads.  The scheme was launched and today all the villages are being 
connected with all weather roads.  Our Prime Minister said that if somebody has 
the right over the resources of the country then the first right vests with the poor.  
The NDA Government is committed to fulfilling the promises it has made to the 
country.  There is rampant corruption in MNREGS.  This scheme was so 
impractical that it could not benefit the people and ended in corruption.  We will 
set it right.  Our Government wants to eradicate poverty.  They gave slogan to 
remove poverty.  When poverty was not removed, they started removing the poor.  
The Planning Commission under their Government fixed quite unrealistic norms to 
determine poverty.  Today, we say that we would provide water in the villages,  
two square meals to the people, houses to live and electricity and road.  But, the 
question  is as to why we could not do all this till date after Independence.  Had 
they done something of it, I can say that the Government led by Shri Narendra 
Modi Ji would have brought a bigger agenda of global level.  But, we have to 
fulfill the basic needs of the country.  We expect constructive support from them 
but if we happen to commit some mistakes, we would welcome your suggestions.  
Our Government wants to give good governance and develop every area."
SHRI JAGDAMBIKA PAL,"The Address of H.E. President  is the 
document of Government‟s policies. All the countrymen have faith and trust in the 
present Government. Hon. Prime Minister has averred that other Governments 
have been given 60 years, however, my Government needs only 60 months. The 
visit of the heads of SAARC countries was not restricted to the oath taking 
ceremony albeit the Hon. Prime Minister used it as an opportunity to hold bilateral 
talks clearing the country‟s stance and foreign policy categorically. Our 
Government took a very important decision in the form of setting up a Special 
Investigating team to bring back black money stashed abroad. The strengthening of 
rupee and the decline in the price of gold in the wake of the formation of new 
Government are itself harbinger   of good days. Foreign and domestic investment 
suffered a setback during the erstwhile Government‟s tenure. The Government‟s 
first priority is investment for which investment summit has been announced. I 
believe that there would be increased employment opportunities in the automobile, 
tourism, banking and the economic sector during the tenure of the new 
Government. Today,  90 districts fall under M.S.D.P. out of which 22 districts are 
in Uttar Pradesh. Modiji perceives every citizen as the citizen of India and not on 
the basis of his caste. The aim of the new Government is to strive for excellence 
and make the country a „Superior India‟. The Government will remain dedicated to 
the poor."
SHRIMATI KAMLA PATLE,"The people of India have delivered a 
decisive verdict in favour of development through good governance under the 
democratic process. The government is committed to creation of “Ek Bharat-
Shreshtha Bharat” by adopting the principle of “Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas”. The 
Address has outlined the policies, programmes and the roadmap of the government 
which will benefit the 125 billion strong population of the country including the 
villages, poor farmers, women and youth. The government is committed to zero-
tolerance towards terrorism, modernisation of security forces by equipping them 
with state-of-the-art weaponry, constitution of an authority for coastal security and 
emphasis on prevention of infiltration. More than half of the districts in 
Chhattisgarh are reeling under naxal extremism. I demand special status for 
Chhattisgarh being the most backward and the least developed state in the country. 
I am grateful for the commitment made towards 33 percent reservation for women 
in the Parliament and State Legislatures, Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative and 
zero-tolerance towards violence against women. I express gratitude for the 
government‟s intentions regarding rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits, upliftment of 
the weaker sections of minorities and welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled 
tribes. I demand that the 16 percent quota for the scheduled castes in Chhattisgarh 
which was reduced be reinstated. The Address has something for all sections of the 
society be it the affluent or the poor section. All the schemes of the government 
will surely result in positive changes in the country. There is not a single Kendriya 
Vidyalaya in my constituency Janjgir-Champa district. Since 70 to 80 percent of 
the area in Chhattisgarh is agricultural, I demand the establishment of a Central 
Agricultural University in the state alongwith the construction of an airport, 
national status for the Kotmi Sonar Crocodile Reserve, inclusion of the survey for 
laying of rail line in Kasdol-Bhilaigarh legislative constituency in the rail budget 
and provision of required funds for the said purpose."
SHRI KADIYAM SRIHARI,"The Hon. President, in his Address, has 
promised that his Government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of 
equal opportunity in educating, health and livelihood for SCs, STs, OBCs and 
weaker sections.  I would like to know from the government as to how they are 
going to create this system. Access to equal opportunity is denied to the weaker 
sections due to socio-economic inequalities suffered by them for centuries.  
Recognizing this reality, our Constitution has provided certain provision such as 
reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs in educational institutions and public services.  
But unfortunately, the inequalities in accessing the fruits of development are still 
staring at us.  While the enrollment rate of children from weaker sections into 
schools has significantly increased, much progress has not been achieved in 
reducing the school drop-outs.   The enrolment of students into higher  education 
from weaker-sections still remains poor.  I would like to welcome ‘Beti Bachao-
Beti Padhao’ initiative of the Government.  I would like to the Government to 
launch a National Programme for expanding residential schools for girls so as to 
provide at least one residential school for girls belonging to weaker sections in 
every block or Mandal in the country.  I would like to request the Government to 
consider guaranteeing weaker sections „Right to Health‟.  The Scheduled Castes 
and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill, 2008 is still 
pending in the Parliament.  This Bill has to be passed at the earliest.  The 
reservation for SCs and STs in promotion is caught up in legal hurdles.  We need 
to enact this legislation without further loss of time.  I hope this Government will 
bring out central legislation on Scheduled Castes Sub Plan and Tribal Sub Plan as 
there are deficiencies in their implementation.  The Government is committed to 
completing the long pending irrigation projects on priority.  It is a laudable 
initiative of the Government.  A long pending project Pranahita-Chevella in the 
newly created State of Telangana may kindly be declared as National Project and 
completed in the next 5 years.  In the Reorganization Bill of 2014 of Andhra 
Pradesh, there is a mention of the establishment of a rail coach factory in 
Telangana. I would request the Railway Minister to consider this and see that rail 
coach factory is established at Kazipet.  I would also request the Railway Minister 
to examine for establishing a Railway Division at Kazipet.  In the year 2012-13, a 
wagon manufacturing unit has already been sanctioned here.  I would request the 
Railway Minister to expedite and give some funds in this Budget and give some 
funds in this Budget and see that this project is started.   
 
KUNWAR BHARTENDRA: All the sugarcane growing farmers of Uttar 
Pradesh hope that the Government will pay their dues.  All the Hindu refugees who 
came from Eastern Pakistan during the year 1950 should be given rights at par with 
all Indians.  Crores of poor farmers should be given protection by saving their 
lakhs of acres of cultivable land from the problem of flood and erosion by 
checking the flow of the Ganga.  The Government of Uttar Pradesh should be 
given instructions to put immediate check on the law and order situation and 
constantly rising incidence of rape and murder."
SHRIMATI JYOTI DHRUVE,"Hon‟ble President‟s Address details the 
road-map of the new Government led by the Hon‟ble Prime Minister. This country 
is an agricultural country but the financial condition of the farmers is very poor. 
They do not get proper support price for their agricultural produce. This 
Government has taken steps to improve it. The condition of the houses of urban 
dwellers is very poor. So 100 smart cities would be developed where all the 
facilities including power, drinking water and toilets would be provided. Toilets 
would be constructed in all the houses in all the villages. Healthcare services 
would be improved and AIIMS  would be set up in all the states. A war memorial 
is proposed to be set up in the country. Pollution level is rising in all the rivers 
including the Ganges in the country. So the Government is dedicated to make the 
Ganga river pollution-free."
SHRI ASADUDDIN OWAISI,"I stand to oppose the Motion that has been 
moved by Shri Rajiv Pratap Rudy and seconded by Shri Ram Vilas Paswan.  The 
Government talks about the inclusive development.  Please understand that the 
diversity and pluralism is the ethos of this nation. How can the inclusiveness 
happen in this august House?  How many Muslim MPs are here?  I agree that the 
Kashmiri Pandits should go back to Srinagar.  We will ask you about that in 2019.  
Hon. President spoke about making minorities equal partners.  How can there be 
equal partners when the Minister in charge on the very first day of assuming 
charge says that Muslims are not minorities?  My question to the ruling party is, 
what about the 4.5 per cent reservation given to minorities, not to Muslims, which 
includes others also like Sikhs, Buddhists and Christians.  There is a mention of 
zero tolerance towards communalism in the Address but see what is happening in 
the nation.  Let me conclude by speaking about my State of Telangana. How is it 
that when I am the right owner of a place, my place is given to the other State 
under Polavaram Project?  It is unconstitutional. I demand that a separate High 
Court be created in Telangana."
SHRI NEIPHIU RIO,"I rise to support the Motion of Thanks on the 
President‟s Address.  I represent the North East Regional Party Front and I would 
like to highlight a few things about my State and the region as a whole.  The 
President‟s Address highlighted and outlined the concerns of the NDA 
Government.  I am especially grateful and happy that a specific mention was made 
of the North Eastern region.  98 per cent of the North Eastern States is international 
boundary and only two per cent is connecting the mainland.  We have multiple 
problems that is, international borders and also the inter-State borders.  We need to 
address the insurgency problems in the States, the border problems, the ethnics and 
particularly the influx of illegal migrants.  At the same time, North East has huge 
potential.  We have huge human resources and mineral deposits and other 
capacities.  Therefore, we should utilize and exploit the potentials of the North 
East, particularly the youth.  We have Food Security Bill, but we should have Job 
Security Bill also so that work culture is developed.  If we just give them food, the 
work culture will be destroyed and the country will not march forward.   We have a 
Naga-political issue which is yet to be resolved.  For the last 17 years negotiation 
is going on , having 17 rounds of talks but it is yet to find a logical conclusion.  
Therefore, my appeal is that it should be expedited and a solution should come so 
that the investors not only from the State but from outside will also come.  Finally, 
I would like to say that we believe that better days are ahead for the whole nation, 
especially for the region."
SHRIMATI RAKSHATAI KHADSE,"The huge mandate given  by the 
people of India as per democratic convention has been reflected in the Address 
made by the hon‟ble President.  The people of the country have opted for “Sabka 
Saath Sabka Vikas” and “Minimum Government Maximum Governance” Mantra.  
The people have certain expectations and aspirations which include various 
schemes i.e. agricultural and rural development, women empowerment, primary 
education and health, various schemes for the welfare of backward sections of 
society, poverty alleviation, employment, self sufficiency in the field of energy, 
irrigation facility to each agricultural field, youth development.  The farmers in my 
constituency are facing difficulties in getting assistance from insurance agencies 
owing to absence of agricultural laboratories.  The farmers are making a demand 
that banana should be included in the category of fruit.  Various pilgrimage 
projects are lying pending in my constituency.  The demand to implement major 
water recharge schemes in Tapi river area in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra is 
long pending.  There is a need to construct concrete road to link agriculture fields 
to the main road.  There is a need to construct Bhusawal-Indore highway.  The 
farmers of my constituency and entire Maharashtra are facing difficulties due to 
untimely rain and snowfall.  The fee and scholarship to the girl students belonging 
to the people living below poverty line, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled tribes and 
Other Backward Classes and weaker sections  in Maharashtra has not been granted 
by the Union Government.  I am sure that the Government will definitely provide 
the said assistance.  The demand to introduce a train from Bhusawal to Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Terminus, Mumbai is long pending.  There is a  demand to introduce a 
Garib Rath Express and a Rajdhani Express for New Delhi on the same route.  The 
resolution made in the Hon‟ble President‟s Address in respect of high speed and 
fast track trains will definitely fulfill the aspiration of people."
SHRI PREM DAS RAI,"The President‟s Address to both the Houses of 
Parliament indeed shows clarity of both purpose and direction and a clear outline 
of the policy framework which is to be followed in the next five years.  I also got a 
feeling that there is a sense of urgency and a sense of cohesion and I hope that this 
entire House will work as one during the next five years of the 16th Lok Sabha.  
The President‟s Address had one interesting point which was the creation of IITs 
and IIMs in every State.  I fully welcome this as I have had the good fortune of 
studying in both these great institutions.  I do believe that an IIT and IIM in the 
State of Sikkim would also be welcome.  We also welcome the intention of the 
Government in strengthening the policy of cooperative federalism. I think a 
Ministry for the Himalayan States should be put into operation.  The security of the 
country, the bio-diversity security, the human security as well as the water security 
depend on the Himalayas.  I regret to say that the Hon. President‟s Address did not 
mention any plan of action to eliminate discrimination against Indian citizens from 
the north-eastern region.  This is as big as terrorism and must be met with a similar 
response both by the law and order machinery and with legislative capacity."
SHRI JOSE K. MANI,"I extend constructive support for all good nation 
building programmes and any law that brings in justice and equality among the 
millions of people.  It is like this that this Government has answered to all the 
problems that face the nation.  I feel that the Government should have been more 
candid in their approach in fixing up the priority.  The President has indicated food 
for all, water for all, shelter for all, education for all and the list goes on.  We have 
a huge number of promises given by the Government but these promises will be 
successful if we could translate them into reality within a time frame.  Kerala is 
densely populated and there is more of agricultural land.  Sometimes I feel that the 
success of Kerala is a failure of Kerala.  You would know the State of Kerala has 
achieved 100 per cent literacy in respect of elementary education.  What we need 
to have is support for higher education; specialized skilled programmes.  I would 
like to urge upon the Government that schemes should be made in consultation 
with the State governments.  I would like to urge upon the Government to stop the 
import of natural rubber for at least one year till the market picks up and import 
duty should be increased by 25 per cent. 
-----"
SHRI VIRENDER KASHYAP,"The Government must fulfill the hopes 
and aspirations of the people by taking concrete steps. The youth are expecting a 
lot from this new Government. They are hopeful of getting employment and work 
for themselves. It is mentioned in the Address that „Har Haath Ko Hunar‟ i.e. one 
will get work as per one‟s skills. There  is a mention of starting a National Skill 
Mission to make a skilled India, which is a welcome step. The most important 
thing mentioned in the interest of farmers is that water will be provided to the 
fields of farmers and for this, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana will be 
launched. There will be more opportunities of employment in villages. There is a 
need to expand the railways and more and more tracks should be laid in hilly states 
and areas. The people of Himachal Pradesh hope that the new Government will 
proceed in this direction. „Rashtriya Himalaya Mission‟ will be started. It is a 
commendable step. Funds should be made available in the ratio of 90:10 for 
Central Schemes by preparing uniform schemes for the rapid growth of all hilly 
states. Ex-servicemen have been demanding „one-rank-one-pension‟ for many 
years. There is a mention of implementation of this scheme in the Address. Now 
they are expecting that new Government will pay attention to do away with the 
injustice being done to them. Each family will get a pucca house which is a 
commendable step. I welcome this Address and hope that the development of the 
people of hilly areas, farmers and garden owners will be ensured in future."
SHRI RAJU SHETTY,"In his Address the President had said that 
agriculture is the source of livelihood of most of our population but the farmers of 
the country are in trouble for the last so many years.  The UPA Government took a 
decision to wave the agriculture loan of the farmers but it only benefit the 
scamsters in banks and touts that is why despite waiving of loan to the tune of 
rupee seventy thousand crores neither the incidents of suicide by the farmers came 
down  nor the farmers could get remunerative prices for their produces.  The 
demand of the farmers was that they atleast should get the cost they have put in.  
But the farmers who came to the street to press for their demand were canned and 
fired at by the police.  The land of the farmers has been acquired but they have not 
got the compensation. Since the source of livelihood of most of our population is 
agriculture, there is a need to increase investment in agriculture sector.  No private 
company  is willing to  invest in this sector because agriculture is no more a 
profitable profession.  Therefore, I congratulate the Hon. President for making a 
mention of crop insurance and post harvesting management.  The Government has 
announced that Pradhan Mantri Sinchayee Yojana will be implemented.  My 
submission to the Government is that if we have to strengthen our economy than 
we will have to be serious about the agriculture sector.  If we provide increased 
price of edible oil to the farmers, the farmers and the country will become self-
reliant in this matter.  Sugar industry is the largest industry of our country but the 
Government is not paying much attention towards this sector.  There is a need to 
pay attention towards scams taking place in the future market.

SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA,"Election results of the 16th Lok Sabha 
have given rise to new hopes and aspirations among the 125 crore people of the 
country. Today, the Dalit and women of India are cherishing hopes for their rights 
and dignified living. The rise in atrocities on Dalits and women in the last 10 years 
have shattered their morale and they are looking upto Narendra Modi as their 
Messiah. Today, the farmers are committing  suicide as they are caught in the debt 
trap. They are struggling hard for getting the remunerative prices of their crops. 
The vision of rail connectivity, road connectivity, sea connectivity and air 
connectivity in  the  country presented by the Hon. Prime Minister will put India in 
the list of leading nations of the world. The Government has talked about uplifting 
the hilly areas of the country. I would like the hilly area of Shilavik in my Lok 
Sabha Constituency of Ambala to be declared backward from the industrial point 
of view in the similar way  as the Ex-Prime Minister Shri Atalji  delcared the Badri 
and Kala Amb areas of Himachal Pradesh. The Morni hilly areas of this region can 
be developed as world famous tourist region. Hon‟ble President has outlined the  
resolve of setting up centres for manufacturing  defence related equipments in the 
country. The cantonment area of my Lok Sabha Constituency is very important 
from strategic point of view. This area can be chosen to set up a centre for 
manufacturing defence equipments. Today, there is a need for strengthening the 
country from the health services point of view. Poverty should be totally 
eradicated. Today, there is a need for making India self reliant  in the energy 
sector. Proper steps should be taken for bringing quality in the field of education. 
Today, there is a dire need of making the Public Distribution System relevant in 
the country. Attention has also been drawn towards the migration of a large part of 
the population of the country to the cities in search of jobs. We have to strongly 
build up the institutional infrastructure in our rural areas. We have to provide all 
those facilities in our villages which the rural population rightly deserves. The 
Government has created a new precedent in the foreign policy of India by inviting 
all the nations of SAARC in our oath ceremony.  
-----"
SHRI AJAY MISRA TENI,"The clear objective of this government is to 
take everyone along and ensure development for all and its vision is Ek Bharat, 
Shreshtha Bharat. It is the priority of the government to develop the country as an 
undivided unit and provide equal opportunities for availing education, medical and 
employment benefits to all. Education, medicine, employment for the youth, 
opportunities to the talented in the field of sports, remunerative prices to the 
farmers, housing, industry, trade, bringing down inflation, establishment of basic 
infrastructure for the development of the country through reforms in the public 
distribution system, making the country prosperous, safeguarding the borders of 
the country and raising the prestige of the country in the global arena are the 
priorities of the government. I hope that the government will formulate an effective 
scheme for addressing the problem of floods in the border districts including Khiri 
Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh, lay broad gauge rail line and construct Pachpedi ghat 
bridge in the area. 
-----"
SHRI N.K. PREMACHANDRAN,"The President‟s Address to this House 
is the basic policy document of this Government.  But a clear-cut specific policy is 
not being well enunciated in the President‟s Address.  There is a mention of many 
schemes, programmes and slogans.  I would like to know from the Government the 
basic and specific policies of the Government in respect of achieving these goals.  
What is the meaning of maximum governance and minimum Government?  Is it 
minimizing the role of the Ministers and maximizing the role of the Prime 
Minister?  I would like to say that the Ministers are accountable to the people 
through the Parliament.  My submission to the Government is that 69 per cent of 
the voters who have not voted for the Bharatiya Janata Party should be taken into 
consideration while enunciating the policies and programmes.  Though the policies 
are not specially stated in the President‟s speech, we can very well sense what is 
the policy of the Government.  What is the defence policy?  100 per cent FDI is 
being allowed in defence sector.  Instead of attracting and inviting FDI, why do we 
not strengthen our defence PSUs.  There are so many appreciable programmes in 
the President‟s Address.  But they will become appreciable only when they are 
translated into action. 
-----"
SHRI SHARAD TRIPATHI,"The President‟s address has talked about 
providing jobs to people with every kind of skill that will provide opportunity to all 
youth living in village so that they can excel in their skill at the national level. The 
Government has envisioned about encouraging the Indian rural games that will 
make the youth of India bag the highest tally of medals is coming Olympic Games. 
The Government has emphasised on the health of the youth through yoga and 
ayush. The principals of all religions of the world can be followed through healthy 
body.

SHRIMATI KOTHAPALLI GEETHA,"I thank the Hon. President of 
India for his Address which has been placed before both the Houses of Parliament.  
I support the Motion and fully extend our support in fulfillment of the policies.  
Though we have crossed 67 years of independent India, yet we are facing many 
problems.  It is mainly due to lack of commitment and dedication on the part of the 
leaders  who have ruled the country.  Even today we are facing a lot of hardships 
regarding illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, shortage of power supply and 
harassment against women.  The schemes and the policies announced by the 
successive Governments have not yet reached the downtrodden, weaker sections, 
particularly the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribe people.  The President 
has rightly said, the challenges we are facing are mainly due to poverty.  Two-
thirds of the people are living in the rural areas. I also sincerely appreciate the 
efforts of the Government for giving 33 per cent reservation for women in 
Parliament.

SHRI C.N. JAYADEVAN,"I cautiously welcome the Hon. President‟s 
Address delivered before the Joint Session of Parliament.  I am cautious because it 
is not the lofty ideals of the speech but the practical result of its implementation 
which will be the one to be evaluated.  The present electoral system in our country 
does not reflect the popular will of the people.  We have been witness to a number 
of declarations on the poverty alleviation from throughout the last six decades.  
Now, we are talking about poverty alleviation.  What are the methods to achieve 
it?  I strongly believe that without deep land reforms and ensuring decent 
livelihood for the rural masses, no declaration of poverty elimination will have 
practical value.  I want to show Kerala model, which has been noted by Amartya 
Sen, the economist.  He said that Kerala model has removed poverty from Kerala.  
Nobody is there in Kerala who is under poverty.  A large number of NRIs from 
Kerala who are working particularly in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region 
contributed greatly to the economic stability of our country."
SHRI BHAGWANT MANN,"In the President‟s Address on the one hand, 
there is a mention of introduction of bullet train and digital India where as on the 
other hand, in the capital of the country people are being asked to not to switch on 
the electric bulb from 10 P.M. to 11 P.M. and not to switch on air conditioners 
from 12 Noon to 2 P.M.   Not to go in the malls after 10 P.M.  When Aam Admi 
Party was in power in Delhi, the electricity supply was double and rates were half.  
After stepping down by the Government of Aam Admi Party, the electricity supply 
has come down to almost half and rate has become double from 1st April.  I have 
won from Punjab by a huge mandate.  I reside in Delhi also and am facing this 
problem.  I want to thank the Government of Akali Dal which is an ally of NDA 
that the people of Punjab have learnt to live without electricity during the last 56 
years.  I want to say that the problem of electricity and water in Delhi should be 
resolved at the earliest.  BJP is in power at the Centre, in MCD and all seven 
Members of Parliament from Delhi are of BJP but they are resorting to dharnas for 
water and electricity.

SHRIMATI RANJEET RANJAN,"Shri Rudy has moved the motion of 
thanks on the President‟s Address for discussion in the House.  Being a lady 
member, I would like to say that the Hon. Speaker has given me two minutes to 
speak and if BJP gives three minutes more to speak, I shall be able to make a few 
points before the House.  I was astonished by the speech of Shri Rudy.  Though, 
this speech was very good but there were no specific points in his speech.  It 
appeared to me that he is canvassing for his party.  I want the Government should 
implement the claims of development it has made in the President‟s Address.  We 
will remind you of your claims at every step.  When will you reduce inflation and 
to what extent?  People have voted for you for this and they want to know as to 
what you are going to do. I want to salute Smt. Sushma Ji for the comments she 
has made that their product has been sold.  But, you will be exposed when that gift 
pack will be opened.

SHRI A. T. NANA PATIL,"The Government has envisioned to take 
systematic steps in order to solve the problems of the common public. The 
government wants to give priority  to check price-rise and to provide 33% 
reservation to women. The most important issue related to the common man is to 
give priority to the construction of pucca houses and toilets and to set up All India 
Institute of Medial Sciences in each state. The Government is formulating schemes 
by minutely focusing on every issue. The Government has made its objective clear 
that it would work diligently with regard to each issue. It is clear from the 
President‟s address that the country is going to move towards a new direction, and 
the target of the Government is to integrate the divided societies which will fulfill 
the concept of „One India, Great India. The Hon. President said that his 
Government is devoted to the poor. The possibilities to fulfill the expectations of 
the people of the entire country lies in it. The creation of Great India is possible 
when development works are carried out through good governance and corruption 
is rooted-out.

DR. RAMESH POKHRIYAL NISHANK: The President‟s Address 
happens to be the declaration of policies and intensions of a Government.  It 
reflects the vision and mission of the Government.  This Address is certainly 
commendable.  In the Address it has been said that the glory of India will be taken 
to new heights.  The President‟s Address is inclusive.  Shrimti Sushma Swaraj ji 
has summed up programmes of the Government in ten points.  I hail from 
Uttarakhand.  Uttarakhand is the forehead of the country.  Puranas and 
Upanishadas were written on that land.  The people of Uttarakhand are patriot.  
Almost, one person from every family from Uttarakhand is in the Army and 
serving the country.  65 Per cent land area of the state has forest cover which gives 
Oxygen.  The status of special state and industrial package was given to 
Uttarakhand but the UPA Government withdrew that from the State Government.  
We met the Prime Minister in this regard and requested him not to give us anything 
new but not also to withdraw from us whatever has already been given to us. Our 
request fell flat. 
-----
DR. THOKCHOM MEINYA: Hon. President says that the new 
Government will take steps to contain inflation, boost growth and create jobs. This 
is the only way to serve and empower our fellow citizens. Government must be 
able to give hope to the people by means of development through Good 
Government and the credibility of the institutions of democracy can be re-
established with the mantra of Minimum Government, Maximum Governance as 
well as mutual co-operation. The Address also mentions about „Mixed India‟. 
There is no mention of insurgents though of Late security situation in J&K and NE 
and shown a considerable improvement. In NE or J&K, which are categorised as 
special category states, Armed Force (Special) Powers Act (AFSPA) has been 
promulgated. I urge upon the Government to repeal this Act for the sack of 
Humanity. Let us eliminate this obsolete law of AFSPA.  There was no mention of 
territorial integrity of Manipur in the address of Rastrapati Ji. Manipur had its own 
territory at the time of its merger with Union of India. The territorial integrity of 
my state Manipur must be protected. In 2001 Bangkok Declaration the ceasefire 
agreement between Government of India and NSCN (IM) was extended „beyond 
territorial limits‟ which claimed four district of Manipur, two districts of Arunachal 
Pradesh and one district of Assam to be merged into Nagalim (Great Nagaland) 
causing a serious law and order situation in Manipur.  I would urge upon the 
Government to find an early solution to the vexed Naga issue. It is mentioned that 
the Government will maintain a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, 
extremism, riots and crime including narco terrorism and cyber threats. I look 
forward towards passing of Women Reservation Bill, Zero tolerance for violence 
against women and special care for girl child are our fundamental duties.  
Measures must be taken to control the rising prices of essential commodities. A 
sincere attempt to address the Issue of terror in the country and abroad must also be 
made. We must be able to give our children a better tomorrow.
